## Codebase Patterns
- Markers are managed via `useMarkers` hook in `src/hooks/useMarkers.ts`
- Undo/redo managed via `useUndoRedo` hook in `src/hooks/useUndoRedo.ts`
- Visual marker rendering happens in `WaveformCanvas.tsx` via canvas drawing in `drawWaveform`
- Marker drag handled in WaveformCanvas.tsx via handleMouseDown, handleMouseMove (global), handleMouseUp (global)
- Use state for visual updates that need re-renders, refs for values that change during mouse events
- `draggingMarkerIdRef` tracks which marker is being dragged (ref for no re-render during drag)
