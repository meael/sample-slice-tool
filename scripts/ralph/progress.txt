## Codebase Patterns
- Context-aware components: Use conditional rendering with fixed-height container to prevent layout shifts
- Test audio files: Available at node_modules/lamejs/testdata/*.wav
- Type imports: When refactoring component usage, check for type-only imports that may need updating
---

## 2026-02-02 - US-001
- Created EditorToolbar component with center-aligned editing controls
- Files changed: src/components/EditorToolbar.tsx (new)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - UndoRedoButtons already has hasMarkers prop for Reset button state
  - ExportAllButton takes onExportAll callback with ExportAllFormat type
  - Use h-10 class for 40px fixed height to prevent layout shifts
---

## 2026-02-02 - US-002
- Context-aware visibility already implemented in EditorToolbar component from US-001
- Conditional rendering: controls only shown when hasMarkers is true
- Fixed h-10 container always renders to prevent layout shifts
- No animation - instant show/hide via conditional rendering
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - React conditional rendering (`{condition && <Component />}`) provides instant show/hide without animations
  - Browser verification should be bundled with integration story
---

## 2026-02-02 - US-003
- Integrated EditorToolbar into App.tsx above the waveform
- Removed UndoRedoButtons and ExportAllButton from header
- Added ExportAllFormat type import from ExportAllButton (handleExportAll still needs it)
- Files changed: src/App.tsx
- Browser verified: toolbar appears when markers added, disappears on reset
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - When moving components, check for type imports that may need to be added/updated
  - Test audio file available at node_modules/lamejs/testdata/Stereo44100.wav
---

## 2026-02-02 - US-004
- Verified only one instance of UndoRedoButtons (in EditorToolbar)
- Verified only one instance of ExportAllButton (in EditorToolbar)
- No unused imports in App.tsx
- Typecheck and lint pass
- Browser verification done in US-003 - layout is clean
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use grep to verify component usage counts across codebase
