## 2026-02-01 - US-004
- Added close icon component for markers in WaveformCanvas
- Close icon (×) renders as HTML overlay positioned above each marker
- Uses Tailwind classes for styling: 16x16px rounded-full, neutral-700 background, neutral-300 text
- Icon positioned centered horizontally above marker line using transform translateX(-50%)
- Added containerWidth state to enable positioning calculations during render
- Files changed: `src/components/WaveformCanvas.tsx`, `scripts/ralph/prd.json`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Cannot access refs during render in React - use state for values needed in JSX
  - Track container width in state (updated in drawWaveform) for overlay positioning
  - Use `getMarkerPixelX` helper with containerWidth state to calculate marker positions
  - Use `isMarkerVisible` helper to filter markers outside visible range
  - HTML overlays with position:absolute work well for interactive elements on canvas

## 2026-02-01 - US-005
- Close icon rendering on all markers was completed as part of US-004
- Verified: Icons render on every marker, positions update with zoom/pan
- No additional code changes needed
- Files changed: `scripts/ralph/prd.json`
