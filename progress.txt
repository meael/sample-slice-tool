## Codebase Patterns
- Use `npm run typecheck` to verify TypeScript types before committing
- Use `npm run build` to test production builds
- Tailwind CSS is imported in src/index.css via `@import "tailwindcss"`
- Dark theme is enforced in :root with #1a1a1a background
- Monospace font is set globally via system font stack
- Use `import type` for type-only imports (verbatimModuleSyntax enabled)
- No parameter properties in constructors (erasableSyntaxOnly enabled)

## 2026-01-31 - US-001
- What was implemented: Project scaffolding with React 18+, TypeScript, Vite, and Tailwind CSS
- Files changed:
  - package.json: Project config with dependencies
  - vite.config.ts: Vite + Tailwind plugin setup
  - src/index.css: Tailwind import and base styles
  - src/App.tsx: Minimal app component
  - tsconfig.json, tsconfig.app.json, tsconfig.node.json: TypeScript config
  - Created folder structure: src/components, src/hooks, src/services, src/types
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Vite's create command may require non-interactive mode with --template flag
  - Tailwind CSS v4 uses @tailwindcss/vite plugin instead of postcss
  - Use `npx tsc -b` or `npm run typecheck` to verify types

## 2026-01-31 - US-002
- What was implemented: Audio decoding service using Web Audio API
- Files changed:
  - src/services/AudioService.ts: AudioService class with decodeFile method
  - src/types/audio.ts: Type definitions for audio metadata, supported formats, and errors
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - TypeScript `erasableSyntaxOnly` prevents parameter properties in constructor - use explicit property declaration
  - Use `import type` for type-only imports when `verbatimModuleSyntax` is enabled
  - SUPPORTED_AUDIO_FORMATS and SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS arrays define supported file types
  - AudioDecodeError class provides typed error handling with UNSUPPORTED_FORMAT, DECODE_ERROR, FILE_READ_ERROR

- What was implemented: Waveform data extraction service to downsample AudioBuffer to peak data for rendering
- Files changed:
  - src/services/WaveformService.ts: WaveformService class with extractPeaks, resample, and calculateOptimalPeakCount methods
  - src/types/waveform.ts: Type definitions for WaveformPeaks and WaveformExtractionOptions
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use Float32Array for waveform peak data (efficient and matches Web Audio API channel data format)
  - Peak extraction finds max absolute value in each segment but preserves signed value for waveform shape
  - Channel combination strategy can be 'combine' (average) or 'first' (use first channel only)
  - Calculate samplesPerPeak as ceil(length / targetPeaks) for consistent resolution

- What was implemented: Marker state management hook with CRUD operations and selection support
- Files changed:
  - src/hooks/useMarkers.ts: useMarkers hook with addMarker, updateMarker, deleteMarker, getMarkers, setSelectedMarkerId, clearMarkers
  - src/types/marker.ts: Type definitions for Marker, MarkersState, and MarkersActions interfaces
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Hook automatically sorts markers by time position after any add/update operation
  - addMarker returns the created marker and auto-selects it
  - deleteMarker clears selectedMarkerId if deleted marker was selected
  - clearMarkers useful for resetting state when loading new file

- What was implemented: Zoom and pan state management hook for waveform view navigation
- Files changed:
  - src/hooks/useZoom.ts: useZoom hook with zoomIn, zoomOut, zoomAtPoint, setPan, setZoomLevel, reset functions
  - src/types/zoom.ts: Type definitions for ZoomState, ZoomOptions, ZoomActions, VisibleRange interfaces
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - useZoom requires a `duration` option to properly clamp pan offset to waveform boundaries
  - zoomAtPoint keeps the specified time position stable under cursor during zoom (essential for mouse-centered zoom)
  - visibleRange helper calculates start/end times based on current zoom and pan state
  - Zoom level 1 = full view (entire waveform visible), higher values = zoomed in
  - Pan offset is in seconds, clamped to ensure visible range stays within [0, duration]

- What was implemented: Audio file drop zone component for drag-and-drop file loading
- Files changed:
  - src/components/DropZone.tsx: DropZone component with drag/drop handlers, file validation, and visual feedback
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use dragCounter ref to track nested dragenter/dragleave events (prevents premature isDragging=false)
  - Validate files by both MIME type (SUPPORTED_AUDIO_FORMATS) and extension (SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS) as fallback
  - Use Tailwind transition-colors for smooth border/background changes during drag
  - DropZone accepts onFileLoaded prop callback - use in App.tsx to wire up AudioService
